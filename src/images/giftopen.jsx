May your life be full of surprises, joy, humor, laughter and happiness. May you smile bright like sunshine and spread it across too like a rainbow ðŸŒˆ. 
Remember, birthday is nature's way of telling you to cut and eat more cakesðŸŽ‚.(HaHa..). Make sure you have enough of 'kaju katli', 'ras malai' and 'gulab jamun' all your life(and be like it too..ðŸ˜œ)</h2>
                <h2>All the good that you have done in past may come to you always and forever. The kind, generous, loving and caring nature that you have got, may it grows by each passing day. Thank you for being there ðŸ¤—. I will always wish for your success and never ending bliss. Have a great day today and everyday! ðŸ˜Š</h2>
